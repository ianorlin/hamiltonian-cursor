HAmiltonian-cursor
==================


This bash script is quite simple it takes in two arguments the same as would applied to swarp to make your cursor travel across each and every pixel. 
If you do not have this package installed it is usually installed in the suckless tools package. 

Doing this for each pixel on a monitor if it is 1080p will take a really long time. As it has to move the cursor over 2 millon times. As this will also make of any subset of the screen with the first being the x or the horizontal axis and y as the vertical resolution.
